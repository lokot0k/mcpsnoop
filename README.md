**Wireshark for MCP.** A transparent proxy that shows every real tool call
between your AI client and your MCP servers, live in your terminal.

## The problem

The official [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
connects as its own client, so it never sees what *your* client (Cursor, Claude
Code, Codex) actually sends your server. A breakpoint only fires once a request
arrives, so it can't show the call the model never made, or made with the wrong
arguments. When a tool silently isn't called, capabilities don't line up, or a
call just hangs, you're left digging through logs and guessing.

**mcpsnoop sits in the real data path instead.** Wrap your server command with
it and watch every JSON-RPC frame live, as your real client and server talk.

## Quick start

See it right away, with nothing to set up.

```bash
mcpsnoop demo
```

To use it for real, wrap your server in your client's MCP config.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "command": "mcpsnoop",
      "args": ["--", "node", "build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Everything after `--` is the command that normally launches your server. Swap in
whatever you already use, like `python server.py`, `npx -y @scope/server`, or a
compiled binary. Then use your client as usual and open the UI.

```bash
mcpsnoop
```

No flags, no socket paths, no startup order to remember. The shim and the UI find
each other on their own, and the UI backfills past sessions from disk.

For a streamable-HTTP server, run mcpsnoop as a reverse proxy.

```bash
mcpsnoop http --target http://localhost:3000/mcp --listen :7000
```

If payloads can contain secrets, opt in to key-based trace redaction. Matching
JSON fields are scrubbed in observed trace copies, while the proxied bytes still
pass through unchanged. Redaction is best effort and only scrubs values under
matching JSON object keys, so secrets in stderr text, string values under other
keys, or frames that are not valid JSON pass through.

```bash
mcpsnoop --redact-key token,api_key,password -- node build/index.js
mcpsnoop http --target http://localhost:3000/mcp --redact-key authorization
```

No server of your own? [Try it for real](docs/TRY_IT.md) against a published
test server, driven by your own client. To inspect a session after it happened,
see [review past sessions from logs](docs/POST_MORTEM.md).

## How it compares

| | MCP Inspector | mcpsnoop |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Sees your real client and server traffic | no | yes |
| Flags slow and hung calls | no | yes |
| Interactive terminal UI | no | yes |
| Zero-config, no flags or ordering | no | yes |
| Capability inspector | partial | yes |
| Replay a captured call | no | yes |
| Session export (json / html / text) | no | yes |
| Single binary, no runtime deps | no | yes |

## Install

### Go

```bash
go install github.com/kerlenton/mcpsnoop/cmd/mcpsnoop@latest
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap kerlenton/mcpsnoop
brew trust kerlenton/mcpsnoop
brew install mcpsnoop
```

Prebuilt binaries for every platform are on the [Releases](https://github.com/kerlenton/mcpsnoop/releases) page.

## How it works

</p>

mcpsnoop is two roles in one binary. `mcpsnoop -- <server>` is the transparent
shim your client spawns, forwarding bytes verbatim while shipping a copy of every
frame to mcpsnoop with no arguments, the hub and TUI. They pair through a
well-known socket and on-disk logs, so neither has to start first.

Because it sits in the actual pipe, not off to the side like the Inspector, it
sees exactly what your real client and server say to each other, whatever the
server is written in.

## Keybindings

| Key | Action | | Key | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `enter` | inspect / drill in | | `/` | filter |
| `esc` | back | | `:` | command |
| `j` / `k` | move | | `r` | replay a call |
| `g` / `G` | top / bottom | | `c` | capabilities |
| `ctrl-f` / `ctrl-b` | page | | `y` | copy |
| `shift`+column | sort | | `e` | export |
| `p` | pause | | `ctrl-d` | delete session |
| `f` | follow | | `?` | help |

Press `?` in the app for the full list.

## Filtering the stream

Press `/` in a session and combine space-separated tokens, ANDed. Plain text
matches the method, tool, id, and payload.

| Token | Filters by | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `tool:` | tool name | `tool:search` |
| `method:` | JSON-RPC method | `method:tools/call` |
| `id:` | request id | `id:7` |
| `dir:` | direction (`c2s`, `s2c`) | `dir:s2c` |
| `kind:` | frame type (`req`, `resp`, `notify`, `stderr`) | `kind:notify` |
| `status:` | call outcome (`ok`, `error`, `slow`, `pending`) | `status:slow` |

Stack tokens to get specific.

```text
tool:search status:slow           # slow calls to one search tool
method:tools/call status:error    # tool calls that failed
dir:s2c kind:req                  # server-initiated requests (sampling, roots)
```

## Exporting sessions

Turn any captured session into a portable file.

```bash
mcpsnoop export -T json|html|text [-o file|-] [session-id|log.jsonl]
```

| Format | What you get |
|---|---|
| `json` | correlated calls, durations, status, tool-level `isError`, capabilities, and raw frames |
| `html` | a self-contained browser file with search and collapsible JSON |
| `text` | a pretty plain-text dump |

```bash
mcpsnoop export -T html -o out.html       # an HTML file to open in a browser
mcpsnoop export -T text server.py-48213   # a specific session, as text
mcpsnoop export -T json | jq              # the newest session, piped to jq
```

Omit `-o` to write to stdout, and omit the session to take the newest. In the
TUI, press `e` to export the selected session as HTML, or run
`:export json|html|text [path]` from command mode.

## Security

mcpsnoop runs the server command you wrap, so only wrap servers you trust, and
run untrusted ones in a container. It never executes anything you didn't put in
your client config.
